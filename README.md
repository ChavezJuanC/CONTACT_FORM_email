Repository Name: CONTACT_FORM_email

Description:
This repository, CONTACT_FORM_email, is designed to provide a simple and customizable contact form that can be easily integrated into websites. It offers a straightforward way for users to send emails through a website without needing a server-side script.

Features:

HTML Form: The repository includes an HTML file that contains the structure of the contact form. Users can customize this form to suit their website's design and requirements.

JavaScript Validation: JavaScript is used to validate the form inputs, ensuring that required fields are filled out and that the email format is correct.

SMTPJS Integration: The form utilizes SMTPJS, a client-side library for sending emails using JavaScript. This means that no backend or server-side script is required to send emails.

Customizable Parameters: Users can easily adjust parameters such as the sender's email, recipient's email, subject, and message body to tailor the contact form to their needs.

Easy Integration: Since it's based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the contact form can be integrated into any website with minimal effort.

How to Use:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Customize the HTML form (index.html) according to your website's design and requirements.

Update the JavaScript file (script.js) with your SMTPJS parameters, such as the sender's email, recipient's email, SMTP server, and port.

Open index.html in a web browser to test the contact form. Ensure that the form validation works as expected and that emails are sent successfully.

Once everything is working as intended, integrate the contact form into your website by including the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
